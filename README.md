# Syntax
050.330/620 is an introduction to Generative Syntax which emphasizes developing a coherent and cross- linguistically valid theory of sentence structure. We will start with simple assumptions and bring everyone to the same place within about three weeks and then update our assumptions and develop our theory further in several major steps. The lectures will focus on English puzzles and well-chosen ones from other languages. Major assignments in the form of problem sets in other languages will focus on demonstrating that our theory is cross-linguistically valid despite having been largely developed on the basis of English. The instructor will make use of elaborate course notes in the form of handouts organized by theoretical themes that follow the order of textbook chapters.

Upon completion of this course students will have


1) developed a comprehensive understanding of syntactic representations from the Generative Syntax perspective, using the Chomskyan Principles-and-Parameters model.

2) developed solid analytical and argumentation skills and applied the theoretical model to languages other than English.


3) developed an understanding of how a particular theory of syntax evolves in the face of new data.


4) the background needed to turn to the primary literature that uses that model and more generally be ready for courses that investigate other aspects of syntax, including more advanced syntax, psycholinguistics (processing), language acquisition, NLP, computational linguistics, etc.
